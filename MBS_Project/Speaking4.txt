N: After having had breakfast at home.
E1: Hey bud! What’s up?
N: It’s your sibling.
P: Oh hey, just getting ready to head out, big projects to work on for school.
N: They nod, reminiscing.
E1: Yeah I remember those days… Lot’s of projects. Some of them got into the gallery thinking about it!
N: They look off to the side, thinking to themselves.
E1: Wonder if they’re still there…
E1: Hey I’ll catch you later! I’m sure you’ll do fine!
N: They head back to their room, muttering about galleries and exhibitions.
N: As you finish packing up your mother comes in.
E2: Oh isn’t your brother the sweetest? They worked so hard through school and now they’re talking about doing exhibitions at the gallery again? Oh I’m so elated!
N: You say nothing, just rolling your eyes and heading out with a wave.
E2: See you later tonight! Good luck on your projects!
N: You head out to campus.
N: As you walk your thoughts turn more and more inward, now that you’re alone.
N: How did your brother get so far ahead? They had all the same opportunities as you…
N: Is it your age? Are you just worse off than them?
N: What did you do differently…
N: As you turn more and more inward you can feel a weight upon you…
N: …
N: You’re crushed.
