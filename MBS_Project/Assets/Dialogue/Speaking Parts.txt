D: As player begins to leave the house..
E: Oh sweetie! Before you go can you take this with you to school and drop it off at the post office? It needs to be mailed before the end of the day.
P: Oh sure mom! It’s no problem.
D: It shouldn’t be too much work, the post office was only a little bit off campus. A break in between classes would make the task fit in nicely.
D: Getting out of the house and starting to head out, your sibling catches you.
E: Hey listen! I need you to do me a flavor: Can you stop by the office of Ms. Lily and tell her I can’t make it to class? She hasn’t been answering her emails and I gotta head to a thing.
P: What thing?
D: Your sibling glares.
E: A thing.
P: Okay okay, I think I know where her office is...
D: You don’t.
E: Thanks! You’re the best!
D: They head back inside, leaving you to continue to school.
D: Scene transition
D: Heading off to your first class you remember that your math class has an exam tomorrow. One you’ve forgotten about.
P: Well  that’s not good, I guess I’ll take time between english and…
D: As you are considering the situation a friend approaches.
E: Hey buddy how’s it going!
P: Hey! Going well, you?
D: They give a faltering smile. 
E: Not good… See I’ve been in a whirlwind of stuff lately, can you help me out with some Chemistry homework after English.
P: Oh! I uh…
D: You falter, helping out means you’ll end up not having time to study today you’d better-
P: Sure thing!
D: You feel your mouth move before you can stop yourself. There’s too much.
D: There’s so much.
D: Time seems to stop.
D: The world has gone dark.
D: Despite that you feel the oppressive feeling of the tasks upon you.
D: Its so much, you had plans for today and now they’re all together.
D: The world is silent.
D: …
D: He is here.
D: After class you step up to the professor to talk.
P: Hello Professor Carmine.
E: Oh hello! How are you doing, something on your mind.
